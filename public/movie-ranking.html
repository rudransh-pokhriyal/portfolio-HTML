<h1>Movie Recommendation</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies/Movie series of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>John Wick Series</h3>
<p>This movie shows a deadly assassin who should'nt be messed with. Great Action and Gun fights.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>shows the hardship of being a man in society where there is no true happiness just a monotous life with inner filled chaos. One of the best perfomance of Bradd Pitt and Edward Norton</p>
<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>contains different short background stories with multiple interesting characters with a common villian which is linked to all. Very fun and entertaining to watch.</p>
